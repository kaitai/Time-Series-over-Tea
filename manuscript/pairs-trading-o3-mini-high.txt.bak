# Pairs Trading from o3

A cointegration-based pairs trading strategy capitalizes on the idea that while individual asset prices may wander due to nonstationary factors, a specific linear combination of two cointegrated assets is stationary, implying a stable long-run relationship. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how to set up such a strategy:

---

### 1. Pair Selection

- **Economic Rationale:**  
  Start by selecting assets that share similar economic drivers or belong to the same industry (e.g., two technology stocks, two ETFs tracking similar indices, or even pairs from different asset classes that have economic linkages). The assumption is that these assets are likely to be cointegrated because they respond similarly to market forces.

- **Preliminary Analysis:**  
  Use historical price data to check for qualitative similarities in their movements. For example, you might consider pairs like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo or two regional bank stocks.

### 2. Testing for Cointegration

- **Engle-Granger Two-Step Method:**  
  1. **Regression Step:**  
     Regress the price series of one asset on the other. Suppose `y_t`$ and `x_t`$ are the two asset prices, then estimate:
     
     `y_t = \beta x_t + \epsilon_t.`$
     
     Here, ` \beta `$ is the cointegrating coefficient and ` \epsilon_t `$ represents the residuals (or the spread).
  
  2. **Stationarity Test:**  
     Apply a unit root test (e.g., the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test) on the residual series ` \epsilon_t `$. If ` \epsilon_t `$ is stationary (i.e., ` I(0) `$), the pair is cointegrated.

- **Alternative Methods:**  
  For more than two assets or to improve robustness, use the Johansen test, which can simultaneously test for multiple cointegrating relationships.

### 3. Constructing the Trading Signal

- **Defining the Spread:**  
  The stationary residual series ` \epsilon_t `$ (i.e., the spread) represents deviations from the long-run equilibrium:
  \[
  \text{Spread } z_t = y_t - \beta x_t.
  \]
  Compute the mean and standard deviation of ` z_t `$ over a historical window.

- **Signal Generation:**  
  - **Entry Signal:**  
    When the spread deviates significantly from its mean (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations), it suggests that the spread is likely to revert. For example:
    - If ` z_t `$ is **above** the mean ` +2`$igma `$, you might short ` y_t `$ and go long ` x_t `$.
    - If ` z_t `$ is **below** the mean ` -2`$igma `$, you might go long ` y_t `$ and short ` x_t `$.
  - **Exit Signal:**  
    Close the position when the spread reverts back to the mean or a predefined threshold, capturing the profit from the reversion.

### 4. Position Sizing and Risk Management

- **Hedge Ratio:**  
  The estimated cointegrating coefficient ` \beta `$ provides the hedge ratio, ensuring that your long and short positions are appropriately balanced according to their long-run relationship.

- **Risk Controls:**  
  Implement stop-loss orders and position limits to manage adverse moves. Regularly review the cointegration relationship, as structural changes in the market can lead to breakdowns in the historical equilibrium.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Rebalancing

- **Continuous Re-estimation:**  
  Since market conditions change, periodically re-estimate the cointegration relationship and adjust your trading parameters accordingly. This can help in maintaining the efficacy of the strategy over time.

- **Performance Analysis:**  
  Track the strategy's performance, looking at key metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and trade frequency to ensure that the cointegration-based model continues to capture the mean-reverting behavior effectively.

### Conclusion

By identifying a stationary spread through cointegration, you set up a pairs trading strategy that exploits temporary deviations from a long-run equilibrium. The strategy relies on:
- Rigorous statistical testing (using Engle-Granger or Johansen methods),
- A clearly defined trading signal based on spread deviations,
- Sound risk management via the hedge ratio and stop-loss rules,
- Ongoing monitoring to adjust to market dynamics.

This approach has been widely used in various markets, from equities and ETFs to commodities and energy, where economic fundamentals often enforce long-run relationships despite short-run noise.
