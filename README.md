# Trying something new: course notes using LeanPub

This repository is copied directly from Leanpub's book template. 

I am trying something new: writing an AI-assisted book. Disclaimer: genAI has significant downfalls (training on stolen materials, hallucinations, wasting electricity on stupid crap, water use pressures, and more). It also presents many opportunities for creation and innovation. With full understanding of the moral complexity of my existence in this world, I'm trying out writing a book of notes using AI. I hope you find it instructive.
